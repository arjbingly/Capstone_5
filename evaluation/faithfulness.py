# Faithfulness score = No of claims from the generated answer that can be inferred from the provided context /
#                       Total number of claims in the generated answer

# Letâ€™s examine how faithfulness was calculated using the low faithfulness answer:
# Step 1: Break the generated answer into individual statements.
# Step 2: For each of the generated statements, verify if it can be inferred from the given context.
# Step 3: Use the formula depicted above to calculate faithfulness.
