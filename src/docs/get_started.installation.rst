Installation
===============
*Since we are just in the development phase we have not published to pypi yet.*

* ``git clone`` the repository
* ``pip install .`` from the repository
* *For Developers*: ``pip install -e .``

Moreover, further customization can be made on the config file, `src/config.ini`.
